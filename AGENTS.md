## Project Summary
A high-quality 3D portfolio website built with Next.js, featuring interactive web experiences, 3D animations (using Spline and GSAP), and a contact form integrated with Resend. The site showcases projects, skills, and experience with a focus on modern creative technology.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Animations**: GSAP, Spline, Lenis (Smooth Scroll)
- **Email**: Resend API
- **Language**: TypeScript

## Architecture
- `src/app/`: App Router pages and API routes
- `src/components/`: Reusable UI and section components
- `src/data/`: Configuration and static data (config.ts)
- `src/lib/`: Utility functions and library initializations
- `public/`: Assets like 3D models and images

## User Preferences
- Contact email set to `elshadayela4@gmail.com`

## Project Guidelines
- Use Resend for contact form emails
- Maintain 3D/interactive focus for all UI additions

## Common Patterns
- API routes in `src/app/api/`
- Data-driven components using `src/data/config.ts`
